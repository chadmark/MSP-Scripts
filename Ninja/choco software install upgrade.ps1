    Successfully completed the action 'Install' for package 'vlc'.

PARAMETER: -Action "ReplaceMeWithValidAction"
    Valid actions are 'Install', 'Upgrade', or 'Uninstall' for your desired package.

PARAMETER: -Name "NameOfApplication"
    Name of the application you would like to uninstall, upgrade, or install. 
    https://community.chocolatey.org/packages is a good resource to find this.

PARAMETER: -Version "DesiredVersion"
    Optionally, specify a version to install.

PARAMETER: -AllowDowngrades
    Allows downgrading existing installations to the specified version.

PARAMETER: -InstallChocolateyIfMissing
    If Chocolatey isn't installed, this option installs it before starting your action.

PARAMETER: -UpgradeChocolatey
    If an update for Chocolatey itself is available, this option upgrades it to the latest version.

PARAMETER: -SkipSleep
    The script waits for a random interval between 1 and 15 minutes before performing an action with Chocolatey to help avoid rate limiting.
    Use this option to skip the wait. For more information, see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/community-repository/community-packages-disclaimer#excessive-use.
